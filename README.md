## What is AWS Rekognition, and What is it Used For?
By now, many people are familiar with tools like Appleâ€™s Visual Look Up (AVLU), which allow users to identify specific items in their photos. This feature has received high praise for its usefulness, whether you're trying to learn more about an object or identify unfamiliar items. Now, imagine being able to go a step further: identifying not just one item, but multiple objects in a single image, each with detailed insights. This is the power of Amazon Rekognition.
